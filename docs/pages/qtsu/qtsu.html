       <u><b>QtSu</b></u></font><br>
      <hr size="2" width="100%"><b>QtSu - what is it?</b><br>
      <br>
      A simple GUI written in Qt5/6 that allows you to run a program as root.<br>
      <br>
      Although there are other programs of theis type most if not all rely on polkit or have a large number of dependencies, apps like ktsuss which this app was inspired by ( available here:http://ktsuss.googlecode.com/files/ktsuss-2.tar.gz ), some like ktsuss seem to have been abandoned ( last commit was 2011 ).<br>
      <br>
      Also it seems that whenever polkit ( which is a nightmare! ) is updated these programs break, so this is the result there are few dependencies just Qt5 or Qt6 and glib and that's it.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Installation</b><br>
      <br>
	  Just run ./configure or ./autogen.sh from this folder then make
      and sudo make install.<br>
      QtSu will use the default Qt version installed ( 5.x or 6.x, version 6.x will be prefered ).<br>
		To install to ( say ) /usr instead of the default /usr/local, add --prefix=/usr, --enable-links will as it says make links from ktsuss and gtksu to qtsu so that some programs that hard code the files think that ktsuss is being used ( spacefm ), default is to enable links.<br>
	  The gktksu link is legacy and will be removed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Usage:</b><br>
      <br>
      qtsu [OPTION] [--] &lt;command&gt;<br>
      Run a command as another user<br>
      -u, --user USER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Runs the command as the given user<br>
      -m, --message MESG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change
      default message in ktsuss window<br>
      <br>
      <b>Simple usage:</b><br>
      qtsu terminal.<br>
      <br>
      If you need to add options use -- like so:<br>
      qtsu -u root -- terminal --hold -x ls -AF /<br>
      <br>
      This programme has the potential to hose your system if used
      unwisely, <u><b>BE WARNED!</b></u><br>
      May present a security risk so use at your own risk.<br>
